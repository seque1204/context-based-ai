# VICI ‚Äì Context-Based AI

VICI is an AI-powered educational platform and research project that showcases applied machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) techniques.  
It enables teachers to upload, approve, and manage content used in AI-powered tutoring while supporting document-grounded retrieval and context-aware conversations.

## Features
- **Context-Aware Conversations** ‚Äì Dynamically maintains dialogue context across queries.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** ‚Äì Scalable vector database pipeline with low-latency semantic search.  
- **Custom Knowledge Extraction** ‚Äì Teachers can upload and approve content; system extracts structured ‚Äúknowledge facts.‚Äù  
- **Role-Based Access Control** ‚Äì Secure authentication and multi-tenant data isolation with Supabase Auth + Row-Level Security.  
- **Analytics Dashboard (In progress)** ‚Äì Query clustering and sentiment analysis to surface learning bottlenecks across student groups.  
- **Interactive Chat Interface** ‚Äì Built-in document management and backend APIs for educational use cases.
